# LDAP-Authentication-with-NextAuth

are you new in Nextjs?

Do you want to have authentication in your Next.js application via Next Auth and ldap.js?

After adding the NextAuth in your application according to the documentation, the most important step is preparing the [...nextauth].js file that definitely finding the complete sample of this file at this date that I'm preparing this repository is too hard.

In this repository you can find the complete sample of [...nextauth].js
